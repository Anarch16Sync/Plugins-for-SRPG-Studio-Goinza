Heal Range Display
By Goinza
Version 1.0
August 2, 2022

This plugin displays a heal pane that shows the healing range of the selected unit.

Note that if a unit can attack and heal on the same tile, the color of the panel will be a mix between the attack panel and the heal panel colors.

WARNING: the heal panel is made using the sortie panel resource. 
 To make this plugin work, make sure that sortie_panel has a different graphic than move_panel and range_panel

As reference, there are three panels that can be used and changed:
    sortie_panel: used for sortie units and, in this plugin, for healing Range
    move_panel: used for the possible moves of the unit
    range_panel: used for the attack range of the unit
