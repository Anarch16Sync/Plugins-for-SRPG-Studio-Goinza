Cursed Weapons
by Goinza
Commissioned by Harrison
Version 1.1
October 2, 2025

This plugin introduces a "cursed" mechanic that is applied to weapons.
A cursed weapon works like any other weapon, but once it is equipped, the unit can't unequip it.
This means that the player can't trade, sell or remove the weapon. The only way to unequip a cursed weapon is to break it. 
If your game supports the broken weapons option, once the cursed weapon breaks, it can be moved like any other weapon.

INSTRUCTIONS
To apply the cursed state to a weapon, use the custom parameter {curse: true}
